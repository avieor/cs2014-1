#C Program Examples

These are the C program examples from my course on systems 
programming (<a href="https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/cs2014">CS2014</a>),
the canonical URL for this is 
<a href="https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/cs2014/examples/c-progs/README.html">here</a>.

##Files in this example:

- README.md - this file in markdown format
- README.html - this file, in HTML format (```'make html'``` to update that from .md)
- Makefile - to build the example and HTML (there's a clean target too)
- hw.c - a version of hellow world

After running ```'make'``` then this file will be produced (if all
goes well):

- hw - the hello world binary

##More TBD
