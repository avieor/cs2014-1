<h1>C Program Examples</h1>
<p>These are the C program examples from my course on systems 
programming (<a href="https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/cs2014">CS2014</a>),
the canonical URL for this is 
<a href="https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/cs2014/examples/c-progs/README.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Files in this example:</h2>
<ul>
<li>README.md - this file in markdown format</li>
<li>README.html - this file, in HTML format (<code>'make html'</code> to update that from .md)</li>
<li>Makefile - to build the example and HTML (there's a clean target too)</li>
<li><a href="hw.c">hw.c</a> - a version of hellow world</li>
<li><a href="stdio.h">stdio.h</a> - a copy of the most standard header file</li>
</ul>
<p>After running <code>'make'</code> then this file will be produced (if all
goes well):</p>
<ul>
<li>hw - the hello world binary</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hello World</h2>
<p><a href="hw.c">This</a> is the canonical first C program pretty much everyone
has written for decades. (<a href="https://www.thesoftwareguild.com/blog/the-history-of-hello-world/">Here's</a>
some history, if you're interested.</p>
<p>And here's the code:</p>
<pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    int main()
    {
        printf("Hello World!\n");
        return(0);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Let's go through it line-by-line since there are so few lines...</p>
<pre><code>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The C preprocessor command <code>#include</code> says to add in the content of a
header file. 'C' header files are traditionally (and usefully) use the <code>.h</code>
file extension, and <code>make</code> and Makefiles know how to handle that. (More
on <code>make</code> in a bit.)</p>
<p>The C preprocessor is basically a program run before compilation that 
eat comments and expands macros/preprocessor directives and then feeds the resulting
expanded code into the compiler.
Note that the C preprocessor isn't really part of the C language and
could be used for other things.
Most C preprocessor commands start with a <code>#</code> character, and we already
saw the <code>#define</code> command in our earlier <a href="../bm/README.html">broken malloc</a> 
example. Since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor">Wikipedia page</a>
for this is plenty good enough for our purposes, we'll head over there for
more on preprocessor directives. (And hope nobody's crapped on the page
in the meantime:-) The <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-2.95.3/cpp_1.html">GNU</a>
page is maybe more officially better, but not particularly readable.</p>
<p>The main preprocessor directives we want learn to use properly in this course are:</p>
<pre><code>    #include
    #define
    #ifdef  
    #ifndef     
    #else 
    #endif
</code></pre>
<p>We'll explain those as we come to them. In this case <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>
says to replace that line with the contents of the file <code>stdio.h</code>. The
angle-brackets <code>&lt;&gt;</code> say to to look for that file in the standard known
places where the operating system keeps standard header files. In this
case, <code>stdio.h</code> is probably going to be in the <code>/usr/include</code>
directory but that varies from system to system. 
<a href="stdio.h">Here's</a> a local copy of that from my system we can look at.</p>
<p>If you wanted to write and include your own header file, say called
<code>myownheaderfile.h</code> then you'd probably have that in the same
directory as <code>hw.c</code> and would use quote characters instead of
angle brackets to signal the preprocessor to look in the current
directory like this:</p>
<pre><code>    #include "myownheaderfile.h"
</code></pre>
<p>Note that, in contrast to C language statements we don't end the
preprocessor directives with a semi-colon (since the preprocessor
directive ins't a C language statement). </p>
<p>Using quotes like that isn't really great practice in a bigger
project though, it's mostly better to extend the standard 
search path for header files to include the directories where
you keep those, and stick with the angle brackets. That helps
if you're using multiple object files in a single executable,
or if you're building a library - more on both of those later
in the course.</p>
<p>Anyway, on we go...</p>
<pre><code>    int main()
    {
        ...
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Every C program needs a <code>main()</code> function, which as you'd
expect is what gets called when you execute the program that
the compiler produced from your source code. The braces <code>{}</code>
mark the start and end of that function.</p>
<p>There are various <em>prototypes</em> for the <code>main()</code> function,
and which you use depends on whether or not you need to provide
input to <code>main()</code> (from the command line), so you could
see any of these:</p>
<pre><code>    // the one we used 
    int main();
    // same meaning, just being explicit that no input is expected
    int main(void);

    // a common form when command line arguments are to be processed
    int main(int argc, char **argv);
    // identical to the previous one
    int main(int argc, char *argv[]);
</code></pre>
<p>There are some others, and some system-specific extensions but
the above are the most portable forms that are most commonly used.</p>
<p>In our case, we're saying that no comand line arguments will be
processed, and that the <code>main()</code> function will return an
integer, which can be used by the operating system to check if
how the executable exited, e.g. with success or failure.
Note that we can still provide arguments on the command line
but they'll just be ignored:</p>
<pre><code>    $ ./hw
    Hello World!
    $ ./hw ignored arguments are pointless
    Hello World!
    $
</code></pre>
<p>And on we go...</p>
<p>The body of our one and only function has two statements,
the first being...</p>
<pre><code>        printf("Hello World!\n");
</code></pre>
<p>This is the meat of the program (slim pickings, eh!) and calls
the standard <code>printf()</code> function with one argument, that
is the string we want to print. Note that the <code>\n</code> there
means "add a new line when printing."</p>
<p>And finally, since we said <code>main()</code> would return an 
integer result we better do that to be nice and tidy:</p>
<pre><code>        return(0);
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to check the return value then the <code>bash``
variable</code>$?``` will display the result the the last
run command returned, so...</p>
<pre><code>    $ ./hw
    Hello World!
    $ echo $?
    0
    $
</code></pre>
<p>So if we wanted a different return value, we could edit
<code>hw.c</code> to return 22 so:</p>
<pre><code>    $ cat hw.c
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

    int main()
    {
        printf("Hello World!\n");
        return(22);
    }
    $ make
    gcc     hw.c   -o hw
    $ ./hw
    Hello World!
    $ echo $?
    22
    $
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the return value here is only an 8-bit value though, so <code>$?</code>
will be whatever was provided to the <code>return()</code> call modulo 256.</p>
