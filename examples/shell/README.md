#First things to do in [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)

This is an example from my course on systems 
programming (<a href="https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/cs2014">CS2014</a>),
the canonical URL for this is 
<a href="https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/cs2014/examples/shell/README.html">here</a>.

If you're installing Ubuntu on a machine at home (a good thing to do) then
you'll be after things like [HOWTO make an install USB
stick](https://askubuntu.com/questions/307802/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-a-usb-stick),
and [things to do after installing
Ubuntu](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/04/10-things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-16-04-lts).
Those are fine things but here we'll assume you've installed Ubuntu 16.04 or
better, i.e. we assume the machines in LG12.


##Files in this example:

- README.md - this file in markdown format
- README.html - this file, in HTML format (```'make html'``` to update that from .md)
- Makefile - to build the example and HTML (there's a clean target too)

After running ```'make'``` then this file will be produced (if all
goes well):
