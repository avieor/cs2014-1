<h1>First things to do in <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a></h1>
<p>This is an example from my course on systems 
programming (<a href="https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/cs2014">CS2014</a>),
the canonical URL for this is 
<a href="https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/cs2014/examples/shell/README.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you're installing Ubuntu on a machine at home (a good thing to do) then
you'll be after things like <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/307802/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-a-usb-stick">HOWTO make an install USB
stick</a>,
and <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/04/10-things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-16-04-lts">things to do after installing
Ubuntu</a>.
Those are fine things but here we'll assume you've installed Ubuntu 16.04 or
better, i.e. we assume the machines in LG12.</p>
<h2>Files in this example:</h2>
<ul>
<li>README.md - this file in markdown format</li>
<li>README.html - this file, in HTML format (<code>'make html'</code> to update that from .md)</li>
<li>Makefile - to build the example and HTML (there's a clean target too)</li>
<li>filecount.sh - a shell script to count files (see below)</li>
</ul>
<p>After running <code>'make'</code> then this file will be produced (if all
goes well):</p>
<h2>Log in to the system</h2>
<p>You should have your username and password, let's say those are
<code>student100</code> and whatever you've been given for a password.
Logging in to the GUI is pretty obvious (I hope:-).</p>
<p>Once logged in, you want to get a command line/shell. There are
GUI based ways to fire up a shell, but <code>ctrl-alt-t</code> also
works and is useful in case there's no obvious icon for a command
line/shell. (There are loads of online guides to getting 
started with the shell, <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-quick-guide-to-get-started-with-the-linux-command-line/">here's</a> one.</p>
<p>Once you have a shell, you'll see a prompt, something like:</p>
<pre><code>    student100:~$ _
</code></pre>
<p>From there you can type commands to the shell.</p>
<p>The shell is (mostly) just another program that  interprets
your commands and runs the relevant programs, so e.g. if
you want to know where your "home" directory is on the
disk you can type:</p>
<pre><code>    student100:~$ /bin/pwd
    /home/student100
</code></pre>
<p>And you see that the directory <code>/home/student100</code> is,
as you might expect, your home directory. (Your home
directory is also stored in an <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-read-and-set-environmental-and-shell-variables-on-a-linux-vps">environment variable</a>, so 
this also works:</p>
<pre><code>    student100:~$ echo $HOME
    /home/student100
</code></pre>
<p>You can now use the <code>man</code> command to get some
help, or search online for loads of explanations as to
how to use a shell.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Careful now...</h2>
<p>You'll also need to be non-dumb of course, as there
are commands that can delete or break things. (Hopefully
not too badly in the lab!) The <code>rm</code> command in
particular is one to be careful of, especially if you
ever tell it to delete an entire directory tree via
the <code>-rf</code> <a href="https://blog.mafr.de/2007/08/05/cmdline-options-in-shell-scripts/">command line option</a>!
So: BE CAREFUL!</p>
<p>There are a variety of different shells available, with
minor variations in syntax when you start to use more
complicated commands and scripting. I use the <code>bash</code>
shell myself and am happy with that, you may choose
another one. There's a <code>chsh</code> command that you
can use to change the shell you're using, check out
it's man page if you want to switch.</p>
<p>You can also personalise the shell (e.g. to set the
kind of prompts I show here), usually via editing
a "hidden" file in your home directory. In the case
of the bash shell, that file is <code>$HOME/.bashrc</code>.
("Hidden" file names start with a dot and are 
not displayed by the <code>ls</code> command unless you
ask to see 'em via the <code>-a</code> command line option.
They useful so as to not clutter things up, but
are just normal files in the filesystem otherwise.)</p>
<p>As a last preliminary, you can change your password
via the <code>passwd</code> command. If you've been given
a crappy easily guessed password, then changing
that is probably a good plan. But if you forget
your new password, expect me, the TA and demonstrators
to be unhappy with you! </p>
<p>You should also expect
that someone else is likely to try guess your password,
especially if a system is accessible to the 
Internet via SSH and allows password logins. In
that case, the chances are that brute-force password attacks
will be made against the system every few minutes.
(As correctly stated <a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/801546/someone-is-trying-to-brute-force-ssh-access-to-my-server">here:</a>
"Unfortuntately, this is absolutely normal and something every SSH server experiences. Welcome to the internet.";-)</p>
<p>Most systems should have tooling to avoid that problem, but
not all do, and you as a user don't know when a
system is well protected or not - so ONLY EVER USE
STRONG PASSWORDS!</p>
<p>The next thing we want to do is clone the github repository
for the course and then run the <a href="../bm/README.html">broken malloc</a>
example.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Clone <a href="https://github.com/sftcd/cs2014">this repo</a>...</h2>
<p>I usually keep repositories like this in a <code>code</code>
directory below my home directory so...</p>
<pre><code>    student100:~$ mkdir code    
    student100:~$ cd code
</code></pre>
<p>Another abbreviation for $HOME is the tilda character (<code>~</code>) which 
is why that may be part of the prompt depending on
your preferences. So, if you're logged in as student100, the following names for that
<code>code</code> directory are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>    /home/student100/code/
    ~/code/
    $HOME/code/
</code></pre>
<p>Of course for <code>student666</code>, <code>$HOME/code</code>
and <code>~/code</code> will refer to <code>/home/student666/code/</code> instead.</p>
<p>Now you want to get a copy of this repository:</p>
<pre><code>    student100:~/code$ git clone https://github.com/sftcd/cs2014.git
    Cloning into 'cs2014'...
    remote: Counting objects: 139, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (89/89), done.
    remote: Total 139 (delta 73), reused 111 (delta 48), pack-reused 0
    Receiving objects: 100% (139/139), 714.98 KiB | 587.00 KiB/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (73/73), done.
</code></pre>
<p>The output you see will differ from the above as I'll have modified
the repo by then.</p>
<p>And now you can go build and run the first <code>`broken-malloc</code>
example:</p>
<pre><code>    student100:~/code$ cd cs2014/examples/bm
    student100:~/code/cs2014/examples/bm$ make
    gcc     broken-malloc.c broken-malloc.h   -o broken-malloc
    student100:~/code/cs2014/examples/bm$ ./broken-malloc 
    Malloc 1 succeeded!
    Malloc 2 failed!
    Malloc 3 succeeded!
    Malloc 4 succeeded!
    Malloc 5 failed!
    Malloc 6 succeeded!
    Malloc 7 succeeded!
    Malloc 8 succeeded!
    Malloc 9 succeeded!
    Malloc 10 succeeded!
    Tests: 10, fails: 2
    student100:~/code/cs2014/examples/bm$
</code></pre>
<p>Yay! Success!</p>
<p>From now on, for clarity, I'll just show prompts as <code>$</code> and
omit the rest of the verbiage. (That stuff is useful though if
you have a number of windows with a shell open, so's you don't
type a command into the wrong place.)</p>
<p>Once you've gotten this far, I'd suggest you play about with the
<code>broken-malloc</code> example, and see what you can change. Trying to
implement and test the <code>realloc()</code> function is a fine
plan.
If you manage to make it better (or interestingly different),
and you have a github.com account,
then feel free to submit a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">pull-request</a> (PR) and if it's good I'll
accept that and maybe use it another year. Put your name
somewhere in the PR I can see it, so's I know who's submitted
what. (I'll even take typo-fixes, as I'm pretty bad at getting
rid of all the typos in my text/code;-)</p>
<hr />
<h2>Editing files... probably using <code>vi</code></h2>
<p>In order to play about with the example, you need a way to
edit files. My preferred tool for that is <code>vi</code> which is
a venerable editor that is still excellent today. 
There are loads of <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/vi-editor-linux-terminal-cheat-sheet-pdf/">vi cheatsheets</a>
available online and spending a bit of time getting 
familiar with <code>vi</code> is well worthwhile - you'll be
using it for many years to come, so getting speedy at
editing with it is really a MUST. You don't need to
do all that at first though, it's fine to learn as you
go and get faster later.</p>
<p>Anyway, if
you wanted to edit the <code>broken-malloc.h</code> file
then you simply say <code>vi broken-malloc.h</code> while in
the right directory and off you go. If you've not
checked out a cheatsheet, you'll likely get stuck
there and never figure out that to exit the editor
without saving changes you need to type <code>:q!</code>,
and to exit saving changes it's: <code>:wq</code></p>
<p>If you've not used <code>vi</code> before this is a really
good thing to ask about in the first lab.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other editors available on many
linux systems, from the most basic <code>ed</code> to 
<code>nano</code> to
<code>emacs</code> which I think is a bit of a monster. Many
people though just love and swear by <code>emacs</code>  (for
too much information about emacs, go <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">here</a>.)
In any case, 
try out various editors if you like and see which you find most comfortable.</p>
<p>BTW, <code>ed</code> is something I've not used in 
many years, and you'll only likely need to use it
if editing a file over a gigantically crappy network
that's dropping almost all packets or that has
multiple satellite hops on the path. But the
fact that tool is still there shows up a strength
of UNIX and GNU/Linux - pretty much no matter what
scenario you hit, there's a tool that works as well
as can be expected for that scenario.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Piping hot shell commands...</h2>
<p>There are loads of commands available to you
in a typical shell and you might want to use the
output of one command as the input of another.
Not surprisingly, that works just fine.</p>
<p>Let's say you want to count how many files
exist below your home directory, including
all sub-directories (like the <code>code</code>
directory we created a minute ago). Then
you can use the <code>find</code> and <code>wc</code>
commands to do that by feeding the output
of <code>find</code> into <code>wc</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>    $ find $HOME -type f  | wc | awk '{print $1}'
</code></pre>
<p>The pipe character (<code>|</code>) basically feeds the
output from the command on the left into the
subsequent command.</p>
<p>In the example above, we also tidied up the 
output using <code>awk</code> which is a bit of a swiss-army
knife for the shell - it can do nearly anything
you want.</p>
<p>Check out the man pages for <code>find</code>, <code>wc</code>,
and <code>awk</code> for more details, and <a href="https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Pipes">here's</a>
an introduction to pipes in the shell.</p>
<p>Another handy thing is to be able to input file
contents to a shell command or to send the output 
of a shell command to a file, so if you wanted to
for some reason record how many files you have
each time you logged in you could do this:</p>
<pre><code>    $ find $HOME -type f  | wc | awk '{print $1}' &gt;"howmanyfiles.`date --rfc-3339="date"`"
</code></pre>
<p>The greater-than character (<code>&gt;</code>) causes the
output of the command we ran earlier to be sent
to a new file.</p>
<p>Today (August 3rd 2017) that'll create a file called 
<code>howmanyfiles.2017-08-03</code> that just contains
the number of files found. (We're sneakily
using the backquote character (`) there
to cause the <code>date</code> command to be 
executed as the file is being created:-)</p>
<p>It seems a little untidy to create a new file each time
though, so we can also get the command ouput appended
to an existing file, and include the number of 
files and the date on one line of the file. That'd
look like:</p>
<pre><code>    $ find $HOME -type f  | wc | awk '{print $1 " " strftime("%Y-%m-%d") }' &gt;&gt;howmanyfiles.txt
</code></pre>
<p>That uses <code>awk</code>'s built-in strftime function, and the
content of the file will end up looking like:</p>
<pre><code>    $ cat howmanyfiles.txt
    197 2017-08-03
    199 2017-08-04
    202 2017-08-08
</code></pre>
<p>(Note that we didn't run the command over the August
bank-holiday weekend - it is possible to do too much work!)</p>
<p>To show reading that file as input we can again use <code>awk</code>
magic to calculate the average number of files as follows:</p>
<pre><code>    $ cat howmanyfiles.txt | awk '{ sum += $1; n++ } END { if (n &gt; 0) print sum / n; }'
    199.333
</code></pre>
<p>And another way to do that is to use the <code>&lt;</code> character to
provide the input to the <code>awk</code> command as follows:</p>
<pre><code>    $ awk '{ sum += $1; n++ } END { if (n &gt; 0) print sum / n; }' &lt; howmanyfiles.txt
    199.333
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h2>A little shell scripting...</h2>
<p>Now that you have a shell and can enter commands, you'll
quickly tire of typing the same sets of commands
over and over. So you'll want to script up sets of
useful commands into shell scripts that you can run
in a single command. You'll also of course tend to
forget the exact syntax for things like that last
awk command and will type things wrong all the time,
so putting more complicated shell commands into a
script is also much more reliable. </p>
<p>In fact, you
can do pretty much any programming using shell scripts
if you like, it's just a good bit slower to use
the shell (which forks processes a lot and is
interpreted and hence slower) than a compiled
C program. OTOH, shell scripts can be quicker to
create and small ones can be very handy.</p>
<p>Let's imagine you do want to be anal about the 
number of files below your home directory and how
the average changes. We can put the commands
above into a file and then run that each time.</p>
<p>Typically people put scripts like that in a <code>bin</code>
directory just below their home directory...</p>
<pre><code>    $ mkdir $HOME/bin
    $ cd $HOME/bin
    $ vi filecount.sh
    ... edits done here ...
    $ chmod u+x filecount.sh
    $ cd $HOME
    $ $HOME/bin/filecount.sh
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>chmod</code> command sets the file permissions to that the
owner of the file can execute it.</p>
<p>And let's see what we might put in <code>filecount.sh</code>...</p>
<pre><code>    #!/bin/bash

    # This counts and records the number of files below $HOME
    # and reports the current count and average over time.

    # Where to start counting from...
    TOP=$HOME

    # where to keep the records
    RECORDFILE=howmanyfiles.txt

    # count the files and record the count and date in a file
    find $TOP -type f  | wc | awk '{print $1 " " strftime("%Y-%m-%d") }' &gt;&gt;$RECORDFILE

    # take today's count from last line...
    lastcount=`tail -1 $RECORDFILE | awk '{print $1}'`
    # take dates from first and last line...
    lastdate=`tail -1 $RECORDFILE | awk '{print $2}'`
    firstdate=`head -1 $RECORDFILE | awk '{print $2}'`

    # figure out the average
    average=`cat howmanyfiles.txt | awk '{ sum += $1; n++ } END { if (n &gt; 0) print sum / n; }'`

    # say what we found
    echo "Between $firstdate and $lastdate, there were on average $average files below $TOP" 
    echo "Last I looked (using $0) the total was $lastcount"

    exit 0
</code></pre>
<p>If you run that with the content of <code>howmanyfiles.txt</code> as per the above
then you should see...</p>
<pre><code>    $ $HOME/bin/filecount.sh 
    Between 2017-08-03 and 2017-08-08, there were on average 199.333 files below /home/student100
    Last I looked (using /home/student100/bin/filecount.sh) the total was 202
</code></pre>
<hr />
<h2>The path to righteousness (or to binaries)...</h2>
<p>When we run a command from the shell, the shell and operating
system search through the set of directories in the <code>$PATH</code>
environment variable, to try find the command to run. So if
you want to run <code>find</code> for example, then program that
will usually be run is found in a file called <code>/usr/bin/find</code>
but we don't have to type the <code>/usr/bin/</code> part of that
because the <code>$PATH</code> variable contains <code>/usr/bin</code>.
You can look at the <code>$PATH</code> environment variable just you can
look at the <code>$HOME</code> environment variable, and you can
also add to it, so that scripts in <code>$HOME/bin</code> can be
run without having to provide the full pathname of the file.
So, you might see/do this...</p>
<pre><code>    $ echo $PATH
    /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
    $ export PATH="/home/student100/bin:$PATH"
    $ echo $PATH
    /home/student100/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
    $ cd $HOME/code
    $ filecount.sh
    Between 2017-08-08 and 2017-08-08, there were on average 202 files below /home/student100
    Last I looked (using filecount.sh) the total was 202
</code></pre>
<p>Note that there are some shell "built-ins" (e.g. the <code>cd</code> command) 
that don't live as files anywhere in the filesystem - see <code>man builtins</code> for 
details of those. And if you're using a smaller embedded 
system based on the popular <a href="https://www.busybox.net/">busybox</a>
tool then there may be lots more commands built in to the
shell itself, compared to in a typical GNU/Linux distribution.</p>
<p>Anyway the last run above shows up a fairly obvious bug in that script that I'd like you
to tell me about.... What's the bug and the fix?</p>
<hr />
<h2>Going a bit further...</h2>
<p>As further exercises for you: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you can change what the script counts, and,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you're
keen try figure out how to run the script every day, say at midnight,
using <code>cron</code>, or,  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>since I'm not sure if you have permission to use <code>cron</code>
on the LG12 boxes, you could figure out how to run it
each time you login, but then you'll need to remove duplicate counts
one way or another if you log in a bunch of times in one day, and lastly,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you could also usefully extend this to do error checking (the
bash variable <code>$?</code> records the return value of the commands
run, so you could exit without damaging the <code>$RECORDFILE</code> if
that's not zero for example), and the whole thing could be a lot
more robust against corruption of the <code>$RECORDFILE</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>A more interesting script...</h2>
<p>What problem? Maybe a n/w timing thing, depending on
what's on the LG12 boxen. This is TBD for now.</p>
